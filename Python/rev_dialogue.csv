"6","                          HENRY","Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. Just  make sure you have the fires ready."
"7","                          FITZGERALD","My supper's in the hands of a hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy.  Hell, my belly feels full already."

"11","                          BRIDGER","But bigger than we figured. Gonna  be a load to haul back to camp."

"25","                          ANDERSON","We're just floatin' farther from  Fort Union."
"26","                          GLASS","The Missouri's no good. Not if the  `Ree's running it."
"27","                          FITZGERALD","So we just float the hell down to Mexico or wherever else this river  takes us?"
"28","                          GLASS","We get ourselves safe outta range,  then track another course up."
"29","                          FITZGERALD","Add weeks to the trip."
"30","                          BRIDGER","Better that than endin' up scalped  on the side of the river."
"31","                          FITZGERALD","Shut up, kid, you don't get no say  in this."
"32","                          FITZGERALD ","And in case you hadn't noticed, Captain, we're twelve men short of what we were. (off the badly wounded TRAPPER)  Thirteen before long."
"33","                          HENRY","I understand our situation, Mr. Fitzgerald. We do like Glass said... put some distance between us and the Arikara, then chart a  course to Fort Union."
"34","                          PIG","Reckon it's better `an lettin' the `Ree find him... take his ears...  slice what's left all to shit."
"35","                          HENRY","So we hike west to the Grand, then  follow it up to Fort Union."

"38","                          GLASS","No posts that far out."
"39","                          FITZGERALD","So if we do this, we do every step  with our own feet."

"42","                          GLASS","You'd have done the same for me."
"43","                          FITZGERALD","You treat that Anstadt sweeter than  any woman, Glass."

"50","                          BRIDGER","I said you shoulda already got a look when he saved you with it  earlier."
"51","                          FITZGERALD","Else that mighta nicked somethin'."
"52","                          FITZGERALD ","And unlike you, I don't need savin' by him or nobody else. Remember  that."
"53","                          FITZGERALD ","Lemme see what's so special `bout  that shooter of yours."

"55","                          FITZGERALD","Well you can stop workin' on it,  and let me have a look like I said."
"56","                          FITZGERALD ","You forget your place?"
"57","                          GLASS","Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it... on the smart end  of my rifle."
"58","                          FITZGERALD","I'd be careful if I was you, boy."
"59","                          HENRY","If you're passed out when we break  camp tomorrow, I leave you here."
"60","                          FITZGERALD","That's the trouble with this part of the world. No mirrors. Niggers  forget what color they are."
"61","                          HENRY","Can't sleep either?"
"62","                          GLASS","Never like closin' my eyes when I'm not sure who'll be standin' over me  when I open `em."
"63","                          HENRY","I keep thinking about Boone and the others... how maybe I should've had  us make camp further up river."
"64","                          GLASS","You're a good man, Captain. Soon as you realize that, these others  will too."
"65","                          HENRY","Your years trappin' and guidin' out here... have you had much  experience with the Arikara?"
"66","                          GLASS","Enough to try and stay outta their  way."
"67","                          HENRY","But you know this country well enough to get us past them... up to  Fort Union?"
"68","                          GLASS","I been here a long while. Whether  that gets us to Union or not..."
"69","                          HENRY","What Fitzgerald said earlier... he  doesn't speak for the rest."
"70","                          GLASS","He wasn't wrong. Truth is that's what I prefer about this country... it's got no eye for the color of a  man's skin."
"71","                          HENRY","Try to get some sleep, Hugh."
"72","                          STUBBY BILL","Shouldn't we have hit the Grand by  now?"
"73","                          HENRY","We'll reach it soon enough. Glass  said to keep this course."
"74","                          FITZGERALD","Glass said. Too bad I don't see  him."
"75","                          PIG","That's on account he's up ahead makin' sure it's clear, and you get  to keep your ears."
"76","                          FITZGERALD","Or he's run off and left us."
"77","                          BRIDGER","He wouldn't do that."
"78","                          FITZGERALD","My bet, that nigger's used to  runnin'."
"79","                          HENRY","UP AHEAD!"
"80","                          BRIDGER","Christ Almighty."
"81","                          HENRY","Glass!"
"82","                          PIG","HUGH!"
"83","                          BRIDGER","He's down here!"
"84","                          MURPHY","Oh, Jesus."
"85","                          STUBBY BILL","He's tore to pieces."
"86","                          ANDERSON","Least he took that Grizz down with  him."
"87","                          FITZGERALD","Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree  around before, there will be now."
"88","                          HENRY","THAT'S ENOUGH!"
"89","                          BRIDGER","Holy Christ, he's alive."
"90","                          HENRY","Get me some water."
"91","                          BRIDGER","Oh, Jesus... Jesus."
"92","                          HENRY","You're going to be fine."
"93","                          HENRY ","I need some rags before he bleeds  out."
"94","                          HENRY ","And your whiskey."
"95","                          HENRY ","Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit."
"96","                          HENRY ","The rest of you spread out... scout a circle around us. Fitzgerald, you and Anderson take west and north. Murphy and Mike south and east. Watch for anyone that  might've heard that shot."
"97","                          PIG","What about me, Cap?"
"98","                          HENRY","Get down here and help me tie off  these wounds best we can."
"99","                          PIG","It won't stop bleedin'."
"100","                          HENRY","We're fixing you up, Hugh."
"101","                          BRIDGER","It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass."
"102","                          HENRY","Roll him over... easy."
"103","                          HENRY ","Get me the kit. We need to stitch  his back up."
"104","                          BRIDGER","What about the rest of him?"
"105","                          HENRY","And I don't know what to do with  that yet."
"106","                          HENRY ","I'm sorry for how this is about to  burn, Hugh."
"107","                          ANDERSON","They're torturin' the poor bastard."
"108","                          FITZGERALD","And riskin' gettin' us killed in the process. Proper thing would be  to end it for him quick."
"109","                          ANDERSON","`Less he could pull through."
"110","                          FITZGERALD","You seen what that grizz did to him. Shit, Glass'll be dead inside a hour. We all will be if he keeps  screamin' like that."
"111","                          BRIDGER","What now?"
"112","                          HENRY","We wait. Does he have any kin you  know of?"
"113","                          PIG","He keeps to hisself. Never  mentioned none."
"114","                          HENRY","Go get the others. Tell `em we're  making camp here for the night."
"115","                          HENRY ","And gather some wood, but make sure it's dry. We don't want much smoke  when we cook that grizzly."
"116","           FITZGERALD ","What makes you think you earned a  claw?"
"117","                          FITZGERALD ","You didn't take that grizz down."
"118","                          BRIDGER","It ain't for me."
"119","                          PIG","Whatta you figure his odds are,  Jim?"
"120","                          BRIDGER","Long."
"121","                          MURPHY","What that bear did to him... I  didn't expect he'd last this long."
"122","                          ANDERSON","I seen a fella go a week once after a lion jumped him. Fever finally  finished him off."
"123","                          STUBBY BILL","Whatta we do, Cap?"
"124","                          HENRY","We give him his chance."
"125","                          FITZGERALD","You ain't doin' him or us no favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer  that way."
"126","                          ANDERSON","Fever's hit. Won't be long now."
"127","                          FITZGERALD","I seen a bad one drag on days."
"128","           HENRY ","Quiet, Fitzgerald."
"129","                          FITZGERALD","We keep sittin' here watchin' him die, only gives the `Ree more  chance to find us."
"130","                          BRIDGER","He's burnin', Cap. Water turns to  boil as soon as it touches him."
"131","                          HENRY","Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead. Grand should be just west of here.  Find us the best route."
"132","                          FITZGERALD","Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make  sense for the rest of us, Captain."
"133","                          HENRY","Get movin'."
"134","                          HENRY ","You two can start digging a grave."
"135","                          FITZGERALD","Least it's a step in the right  direction."
"136","                          FITZGERALD","Any coyote digs that deep deserves  the meal."
"137","                          FITZGERALD ","Glass won't know the difference no  ways."
"138","                          PIG","Found it, Cap. Right where Glass  had us headed."
"139","                          ANDERSON","No more than a mile or so out."
"140","                          HENRY","We could build a litter. Haul him  with us."
"141","                          ANDERSON","It's rocky and steep goin'."
"142","                          PIG","Marshy and thick on the other side.  We could try it, but..."
"143","                          FITZGERALD","I signed on as a trapper, not a  goddamn mule."
"144","                          BRIDGER","Shape he's in... I don't see no way  he'd make bein' drug."
"145","                          HENRY","Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr.  Bridger."
"146","                          BRIDGER","But, Captain."
"147","                          HENRY","Do it."
"148","           HENRY ","Step clear, Mr. Bridger."
"149","                          HENRY ","There's a seventy dollar bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men that stay with Glass... see this through. Then give him a  proper burial."
"150","                          BRIDGER","I'll stay with him... money or not."
"151","                          PIG","Same here."
"152","                          HENRY","I can't let you stay back, Pig. Without Glass, I'll need you to  scout."
"153","                          HENRY ","Just need one more."
"154","                          FITZGERALD","Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new  setta ears."
"155","                          HENRY","A hundred then."
"156","                          BRIDGER","They can have my share too. I owe  Glass that at least."
"157","                          FITZGERALD","That case I'll hang back with the kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or  so behind for two hundred."
"158","                          HENRY","But Glass is to be cared for until.  Understood?"
"159","                          FITZGERALD","I'll let the young doctor do his  job."
"160","                          HENRY","The rest gather your gear."
"161","                          PIG","I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh."
"162","                          HENRY","(to Fitzgerald and BRIDGER)  As long as necessary."
"163","                          BRIDGER","I'll look after him."
"164","                          FITZGERALD","I'll take first watch."
"165","                          BRIDGER","Not with his rifle."
"166","                          FITZGERALD","Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be  needin' it tonight."
"167","                          FITZGERALD","You were right to protect this."
"168","                          FITZGERALD","When are you gonna die, boy?"
"169","                          FITZGERALD ","I'm nearly a week behind Henry's bunch on accounta havin' to tend to you. Be easier on us all if you'd  take that last breath."
"170","                          FITZGERALD ","I could help ya with that if you'd like. Muzzle ya right now... end all this sufferin' quick and easy.  Nobody'd ever know you give up."
