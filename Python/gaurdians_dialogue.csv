"56","                                             QUILL","That's nothing like what I just said. But they're worth thousands of units a piece. Which is why the  Sovereign hired us to protect them."
"57","                                             QUILL ","Just be careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended and the cost of  transgression is death."
"58","                                             DRAX","Sounds judgmental for a bunch of  golden morons."

"69","                                             AYESHA","I understand she is your sister?"
"70","                                             GAMORA","She's worth no more to me than the  bounty due for her on Xandar."
"71","                                             AYESHA","Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.  Do with her as you please."

"76","                                             QUILL","He's... not from Missouri, that's  all I know."
"77","                                             AYESHA","I see it within you, an unorthodox genealogy. A hybrid that seems  particularly... reckless."
"78","                                             ROCKET","You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags. But that  isn't true at all."

"84","                                             QUILL","That stuff about my father. Who  does she think she is?"
"85","                                             GAMORA","I know you're sensitive about that."
"86","                                             QUILL","I'm not sensitive about it. I just  don't know who he is."
"87","                                             QUILL ","Sorry if it looked like I was  flirting with her. I wasn't."

"93","                                             DRAX","I first met my beloved at a war  rally."

"96","                                             QUILL","Well, that is pretty hot, but--"
"97","                                             DRAX","It would make my nether regions  ENGORGE -"
"98","                                             QUILL","All right, okay, fascinating, don't need to hear it. I get your point,  I'm a dancer and Gamora is not."
"99","                                             DRAX","You just need to find a woman who  is pathetic, like you."
